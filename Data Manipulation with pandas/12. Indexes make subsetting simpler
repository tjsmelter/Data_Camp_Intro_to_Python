# when the name is just a column, this is how we have to subset

dogs[dogs['name'].isin(['Bella','Stella'])]

# But when we change the name to the index, it makes subsetting simpler
# We will use 'loc' here, which is a subsetting method that allows us to filter on index values

dogs_ind.loc[['Bella','Stella']]


# index values don't need to be unique

dogs_ind2 = dogs.set_index("breed")
print(dogs_ind2)

# Then if we subset on 'Labrador'
# We will get the two different labradors that are contained in the dataset
