# you can also slice data frames, but first you need to sort the index

dogs_srt = dogs.set_index(['breed','color']).sort_index()

# Slixing the inner index correctly (with tuples)

# Since data frames are 2 dimensional objects, you can also slice columns
# The simplest case involves subsetting columns, but keeping all rows

# Slice twice

# An important use case of slicing is to slice a date range
# To do this, first we need to set the index as date

# Slice by dates
# Now lets get the dogs with date_of_birth between 2014-08-25 and 2016-09-16
