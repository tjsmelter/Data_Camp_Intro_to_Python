Pivoting on one variable
Pivot tables are the standard way of aggregating data in spreadsheets.

In pandas, pivot tables are essentially another way of performing grouped calculations. 
That is, the .pivot_table() method is an alternative to .groupby().

In this exercise, you'll perform calculations using .pivot_table() to replicate the calculations you 
performed in the last lesson using .groupby().

sales is available and pandas is imported as pd.


Instructions 1/3

Get the mean weekly_sales by type using .pivot_table() and store as mean_sales_by_type.

# Pivot for mean weekly_sales for each store type
mean_sales_by_type = sales.pivot_table('weekly_sales','type')

# Print mean_sales_by_type
print(mean_sales_by_type)

2/3
Get the mean and median of weekly_sales by type using .pivot_table() and store as mean_med_sales_by_type.

# Pivot for mean and median weekly_sales for each store type
mean_med_sales_by_type = sales.pivot_table('weekly_sales','type',aggfunc=('mean','median'))

# Print mean_med_sales_by_type
print(mean_med_sales_by_type)


3/3

Get the mean of weekly_sales by type and is_holiday using .pivot_table() and store as mean_sales_by_type_holiday.

# Pivot for mean weekly_sales by store type and holiday 
mean_sales_by_type_holiday = sales.pivot_table('weekly_sales','type','is_holiday')

# Print mean_sales_by_type_holiday
print(mean_sales_by_type_holiday)
