#Pivot tables are just data frames with sorted indexes
#Create a pivot table with breed as the index, color as the columns, and height as the value 

dogs_height_by_breed_vs_color = dog_pack.pivot_table("height_cm", index="breed", columns="color")

# loc and slicing options are ideal for subsetting pivot tables

# summary statistic methods have an axis argument, the default value is "index" 
# which means calculate the statistic across rows

# to caluculate summary statistics across columns, set the axis to "columns"
