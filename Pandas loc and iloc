loc - label based
iloc - integer position based


# Let's say we want to output a specific row from a data frame

dataframename.loc["row_name"]

brics.loc["RU"]

# however this presents the data in different rows, which is not very helpful

#lets try this

brics.loc[["RU"]]

# now the output will be shown as a dataframe

Country capital area population
RU Russia Moscow 17.1  143.5

# we can also add other rows (or countries) to the list

brics.loc [["RU","IN","CH"]]


# now what if we want to do a similar call like above but this time only pull specific columns

brics.loc[["RU", "IN", "CH",], ["country", "capital"]]

# what if we want to select all rows but only specific columns?

brics.loc[:, ["country", "capital"]]


# what if you want to subset a datafram based on its position not its name
# then you need to use iloc

brics.iloc[[1]]

# to pull rows 1-3

brics.iloc[[1,2,3]]

# all rows and only the country and capital columns

brics.iloc[:, [0,1]]
